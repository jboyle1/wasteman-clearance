## Name of Project: Wasteman Clearance

I developed this website for a client who has a waste clearance company. For this commission the client wanted full branding and social media marketing services. I was happy to provide this. I have a degree in graphic design and know what is involved in branding and marketing. 

I included a logo, flyers, business cards, social media graphics, and a website in this job. There are mockups of each in the image slides. This is a simple, single page, static website. The clients needs were uncomplicated. I spent more time on the branding than the actual site. It is fully responsive and links to all of his social media pages. I created an animation for his Facebook sponsored adverts.
